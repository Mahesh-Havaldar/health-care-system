# Health-Care-System
A machine learning project for predicting diseases based on symptoms, with training and testing notebooks, and medication recommendation support.
# Disease Prediction System

This project is a **Machine Learning based Disease Prediction System** with a **Tkinter GUI**.  
It predicts the disease based on the user’s symptoms and recommends medications accordingly.

## 🚀 Features
- Symptom-based disease prediction using ML model
- Handles spelling mistakes with fuzzy matching
- Medicine recommendation system from dataset
- Interactive Tkinter GUI with background image
